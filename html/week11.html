      <li><input type="checkbox" class = "cb"> In-class work time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project 2</h3>

    <p>Using p5*js, use the canvas to create an interactive artwork. It may be a short comic or animation, cubistic and abstract. It my be inspired by some of the works we've seen before, or completely your own.</p>
    <h5>Required Elements</h5>
    <p>The following elements *must* be in your piece</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a moving element (bounce off walls, circular, spiral, or sine wave movement)
      <li>a <code>function</code> that *you* have made to organize your code
      <li>use <code>rotate()</code> or <code>scale()</code> to transform a drawn element (circle, square, rectangle, polygon, line, etc.) at least once in your code.
    </ul>

    <h5>Tips</h5>
    <p>Get all of the required coding elements in your sketch. These are worth 1/3 of your project grade! Start by putting these elements in the same sketch (perhaps before endeavoring to bring together the art work).</p>
    <p>For this assignment, you should <b>not</b> need to borrow and cite any code (it is easy for me to see if you submit code which is beyond your ability!).</p>
    <p>These coding techniques have been taught in class. If you do not remember or know how to do something -- use your resources to brush up. It is normal not to remember every single thing -- make it easy on yourself and use your resources!</p>
