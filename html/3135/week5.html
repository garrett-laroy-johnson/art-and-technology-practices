    <h3>Unit 1 Project</h3>
    <p>After learning how to integrate live data streams via APIs into our sketches, your first project will be display visually (or otherwise) the remaining <a href="https://github.com/OlafVal/CO2Budget.js>">carbon budgeted</a> before a global
      increase in temperature of 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
    <h4>requirements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>use p5*js techniques you have learned from the teach-in. expand your toolkit as necessary</li>
      <li>use the co2 clock API provided in the tutorial below</li>
      <li>you may use text, but you must also use graphical drawing to visualize some data taken from the API.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of remaining co2 budget is really big. There aren't enough pixels on the screen to represent it. A 4K display has <b>8,294,400</b> pixels, compared to the number of tons of co2 left when writing this: 288,504,002,234. We would
        need ~35 thousand 4k monitors just to display each ton of carbon as a single pixel. How will you make a meaningful reduction?</li>
      <li>The data changes overtime, so you must think it terms of animation rather than a still image.</li>
      <li>data visualization always makes some aspects of a phenomenon more palpable and rendering other aspects more opaque. What does your visualization focus on? What are the limitations of your visualization?</li>
      <li>If your visualization is indistinguishable from a counter moving downward, is there some context to add?</li>
      <li>make a decision about whether you want a "na√Øve viewer" to "get" what's being displayed.</li>
      <li>consider the "carbon liberation front" front from McKenzie Wark's essay. Without copying her technique, how can you leverage the approach in your visualization?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tutorial</h3>
    <p>This tutorial provides some usage instructions for accessing carbon data in p5.js. This <a href="https://github.com/OlafVal/CO2Budget.js">library</a> is developed by Olaf Val and pulls from the Mercator REsearch Institute on Global Commons and
      Climate Change. You can see their visualization of the climate clock <a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/fileadmin/data/clock/carbon_clock.htm">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The GitHub page has an extensive reference you should continue to look at as you prototype your visualization. Here are a few key upshots to keep in mind.</p>
    <p>View the code embedded below. Inspect the "sketch files" using the collapsible window on the left. Notice that <code>co2budget.js</code> has been added. This contains all the code you need to call co2 functions.</p>
    <p>Inspect the <code>index.html</code> file. Notice on line 6 and 7 that a reference to the <code>co2budget.js</code> file has been added. You need to take this step in order to call the co2 functions!
    <p>Inspect the code below. Notice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I use two arrays. <ul>
          <li><code>times</code> keeps track of the current clock's years, months, etc.</li>
          <li>I also use a <b>two dimensional array</b> called <code>circles</code>. This holds all the <code>TimeCircle</code> JS objects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I used the <code>Class</code> keyword to make a template for each JS Object I want to make. Each TimeCircle object has a unique X and Y position and a radius that corresponds to its time unit (Y, M, D, etc.). As a result, the randomly
        generated values each TimeCircle object persists between frames, so the circle can stay in the same place.</li>
      <li>I made my own function called <code>updateClock()</code>. This encapsulates all the clock updating operations: clearing the <code>times</code> array, calling each function, and adding them into the array</li>
      <li>notice my reliance on <code>for loops</code>. For dealing with large numbers of operations, there's no way around them.</li>
    </ul>
