<h2>Week 6: Project 1</h2>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Project Presentations and Critiques</li>
  <li>Introduce "Transformations and Movement" for Week 7</li>
</ol>

<h3>Project 1</h3>

<p>Using p5*js, use the canvas to create an interactive artwork. It may be a short comic or animation, cubistic and abstract. It my be inspired by some of the works we've seen before, or completely your own.</p>
<h5>Required Elements</h5>
<p>The following elements *must* be in your piece</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>if/else</code> to structure interaction
  <li><code>mouseX, mouseY</code> to drive interaction
  <li>At least (2) *types* of 2D primitives
    <li>A <code>for loop</code>
      </ul>

<h5>Tips</h5>
<p>Start by getting all your elements to work inside a single sketch. Use <code>print()</code> or <code>console.log()</code> to test that things are working.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be a masterpiece -- think of it as a study.</p>
<p>Consider how you use the interactivity. The example of interactivity from the page was pretty simple. How can the interactivity help to drive the narrative or drama of your piece?</p>

<p>We've used <code>for loop</code>s to draw rows and columns. You could do that, or you could break out of the grid. The <code>random()</code>function may be your friend here.</p>

<h4>Other Materials</h4>
<p>Review assignments, readings, and videos from weeks 2-4.</p>
