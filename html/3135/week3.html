    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <h4>p5*js 101 teach-in</h4>
    <p>The tired yet wired adage goes: if you can teach it, you can learn it. Or something like that. Your assignment is to work alone or with an assigned partner on a fundamental p5*js concept area in preperation to teach it to the rest of the class.</p>

    <p>You may draw on any materials you like for this assignment. The <b>Getting Started</b> textbook is highly recommended; I have indicated some example numbers below to get you started. You can also check out my <a href="../../2101/index.html">p5*js intro course website</a> which is organized by these concept areas. Each page has links to video tutorials which may be helpful.</p>

      <p>You should prepare:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>a 10-20 minute tutorial for the rest of the class. Aim to cover as many of the coding functions and concepts listed below as are reasonable within that time limit.
    </li>
    <li>
    a p5*js sketch "cheat sheet" that shows all the concepts and functions in action. Label these concepts and functions with a JS <code>comment</code>. The visual appeal of what is drawn in this "cheat sheet" are *not* important. Aim instead to create an instructive document with pedagogy in mind.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>p5*js 101 presentations pt. 2:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>media (images, fonts)</li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>function preload()</code> + callback [ex. 7-1, 7-7, 7-8]</li>
        <li><code>image()</code> [ex. 7-1, 7-2, 7-3]</li>
        <li>image types (png, gif, svg)</li>
        <li><code>textFont()</code> [ex. 7-9]</li>
      </ul>
      <li>movement</li>
      <li>functions</li>
      <li>JS objects</li>
      <li>arrays</li>
</ul>
