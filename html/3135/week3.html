    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <h4>p5*js 101 teach-in</h4>
    <p>The tired yet wired adage goes: if you can teach it, you can learn it. Or something like that. Your assignment is to work alone or with an assigned partner on a fundamental p5*js concept area in preperation to teach it to the rest of the
      class.</p>
    <p>You may draw on any materials you like for this assignment. The <b>Getting Started</b> textbook is highly recommended; I have indicated some example numbers below to get you started. You can also check out my <a
        href="../../2101/index.html">p5*js intro course website</a> which is organized by these concept areas. Each page has links to video tutorials which may be helpful.</p>
    <p>You should prepare:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a 10-20 minute tutorial for the rest of the class. Aim to cover as many of the coding functions and concepts listed below as are reasonable within that time limit. </li>
      <li> a p5*js sketch "cheat sheet" that shows all the concepts and functions in action. Label these concepts and functions with a JS <code>comment</code>. The visual appeal of what is drawn in this "cheat sheet" are *not* important. Aim instead
        to create an instructive document with pedagogy in mind. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>p5*js 101 presentations pt. 2:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>movement</li>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <li>functions</li>
      <ul>
        <li>use a function to quickly draw multiple complex shapes (> 2 simple 2D shapes) using a <code>function</code> [ex 9-3, 9-4, 9-5, 9-6]</li>
      </ul>
      <li>JS objects</li>
      <ul>

        <li>creating many objects [ex. 10-2]</li>
      </ul>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li><code>array</code> as holder of variables [ex. 11-3] + filled w. <code>for loop</code></li>
        <li>assigning and declaring <code>arrays</code> [ex 11-4, 11-5]</li>
        <li>accessing contents of arrays using <code>[]</code> notation [ex. 11-6]</li>
        <li>using <code>for loops</code> to manage many JS objects [ex. 11-9] </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
