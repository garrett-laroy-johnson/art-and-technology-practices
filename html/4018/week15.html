    <h3>Project 3</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>Let's bring it all together. Create an artwork using some of the techniques from this course.</p>
    <p>Consider our worldmaking introduction. How does your work give us a pespective into another world? Or, by extension, into our own?</p>
    <h4>Expectations</h4>

          <li>
            Text. Your piece should be conceptually or materially grounded. You will explicate this grounding in 200 words which will be published alongside your piece in your exhibition.
