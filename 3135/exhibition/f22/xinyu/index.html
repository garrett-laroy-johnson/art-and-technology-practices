    <p>I put all my confusion and anxiety in my "universe", and I keep rotating the cube on the central, as if I am reflecting on myself.</p>

      <p>Magellan proved that the world is round. And then they say that no matter which direction you go, you will return to the original point. For me, I think the world is cube. No matter where I go, I will meet the boundary, be blocked. And the earth doesn't spin on its own. I have to tell myself that the other side may be different, that Neverland might be there. Then I turned to the other side and found the boundary still there.</p>
      
      <p>The noise on the surface of the cube is like a layer of fog that wraps me, making me lost in the universe. I need to make decisions, try to break through the boundaries, and go to a place where I can see the world and myself. I try to start from different directions and be influenced by the voices around me, even if every decision has completely opposite sides, but what is the result. . . ?</p>
      
      <p>I could only keep rotating the cube on the central, as if I was reflecting on myself.</p>
