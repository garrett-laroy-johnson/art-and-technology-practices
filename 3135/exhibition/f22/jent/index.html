  <p class="p1">Words have more power and friction when they are tangible and touchable. Communication with the computer has always depended on physical touches such as taking input via keyboards, etc. However, in this project, I want to show ways we can communicate with the program without any physical touch, utilizing Mediapipe hand-tracking API and speech-to-text API from IDMNYU. The viewer can see and touch their own words, their own thought. The webcam leaves the audience to reflect upon themselves and what they say on a more concrete level with the sense of virtual touch. The dispersion of particles from your words presents the biology of each character. Using steering behavior (a set of behaviors including arrive, flee, seek, target, etc) makes the interaction more realistic, simulating real-life physics, generating friction happening on the screen even without natural physical touch.</p>
