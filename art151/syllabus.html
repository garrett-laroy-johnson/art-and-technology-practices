        <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
          This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer
          programming with an emphasis on using creative practices to formulate
          new ideas. No previous programming experience is required. Students
          will develop a technical aptitude for generating dynamic and
          data-driven visual projects, and through a socio-historical analysis
          of computation, art and philosophy, contextualize their projects with
          an understanding of how computation has augmented how we make meaning
          from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout
          the semester, students will experiment and develop their own
          strategies to develop and evaluate project rubrics and goals. Students
          will complete the class with a foundation of technical skills to
          pursue individual learning of more advanced programming, scripting,
          and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.
        </p>

        <p>
          The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions,
          tutorials, project work, and student critiques. *Note: Students are
          required to have a device that enables internet browsing and
          downloading large files.
        </p>

        <h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <ul>
          Students will:
          <li>
            Acquire a vocabulary to unpack programming concepts and techniques
            with confidence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critically examining how new media art is entangled in histories of
            culture and technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging
            with computation
          </li>
          <li>
            Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.
          </li>
          <li>Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.</li>
          <li>
            Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful
            artistic compositions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
        <h5>Department of Art, UIC</h5>
        <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
        <p>
          This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will
          be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will
          primarily consist of assignment completions, project development,
          project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact /
          Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is
          calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
        </p>

        <h3>Grading Key</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            A = outstanding accomplishment in all assignments (technically and
            conceptually), excellent engagement with ideas and materials,
            excellent participation in classroom community (vocal, inquisitive,
            and ALWAYS thoughtful), full attendance, exceptional progress in
            artistic process
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            B = above average accomplishment in all assignments, strong
            engagement with ideas and materials, work falls short of fully
            embodying the initial conceptual or formal impetus. during class,
            you are invested when you choose, but lack the rigor to ALWAYS be
            present in class. full attendance and above average progress
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            C = average accomplishment of all assignments, work submitted on
            time, some engagement with ideas and materials, some participation
            in classroom community, full attendance, average progress, Student
            shows lack of motivation and interest in thoroughly developing their
            skills as an artist, student, and citizen.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            D = the work does not meet the assignments criteria, some
            assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner,
            little engagement with ideas and materials, irregular or damaging
            participation in classroom community, irregular attendance, minimal
            progress
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            F = a number of assignments not completed or completed in a
            perfunctory manner, little or no evidence of engagement with ideas
            and materials, lack of participation in classroom community, failure
            to arrive prepared for class routinely, irregular attendance, little
            or no evidence of progress
          </li>
        </ul>

        *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of a C or
        above.

        <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">18% - Coding Sketches</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">18% - Project 1</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">18% - Project 2</li>

          <li class="list-group-item">10% - Participation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>
          Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes
          and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is
          for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for
          students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission
          is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class
          during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will
          be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive
          on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect
          negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there
          are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from
          arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a
          doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maximum: two unexcused absences for the semester.</li>
          <li>
            Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.
          </li>
          <li>
            One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused
            absence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.
          </li>
          <li>
            Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is
            equivalent to not having your work ready. It will result in a
            failing grade for that assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Class schedule</h2>
        <p>
          This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule
          will change depending on class performance during the semester.
          Adjustments will be announced during class time when changes occur.
        </p>
        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p>
          Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not
          acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often
          closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work
          undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the
          class as a whole.
        </p>
        <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
        <p>
          During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone
          calls; view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the
          internet for any purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be
          asked to leave the classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell
          phone, web surfing, or social media distractions will be counted as
          missed class time (ie, an absence), and will contribute to the
          lowering of your grade.
        </p>
        <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the
          University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of
          people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to
          provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes
          disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is
          vital to an academic community.
        </p>
        <p>
          UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design,
          alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability
          community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes
          equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for
          qualified individuals with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access
          and participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the
          <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/">Disability Resource Center (DRC)</a>.
          Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123 (TDD).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>During the first week of the semester</b> a student who has a
          letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule
          a meeting with their instructor(s) so that you may create + agree upon
          a clear plan for implementing accommodations.
        </p>
        <h2>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h2>
        <p>
          In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural
          diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations
          or requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious
          holidays. Students who wish to observe their religious holidays must
          notify the instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be
          absent unless their religious holiday is observed on or before the
          tenth day, in such case students must notify instructor at least five
          days in advance of the date when he or she will be absent.

        <h2>Safe Space</h2>
        <p>
          The UIC School of Art & Art History is committed to creating a safe
          space in our classrooms that is a welcoming, supportive, and safe
          environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ)
          students. See also:

        <h2>Image Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
          Images of projects created in this course may be used for educational
          purposes, including instruction in future courses and promotion of the
          School, College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or
          distributing any of your work for these purposes, please discuss these
          with your instructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Cheating</h2>
        <p>
          In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught copying homework,
          plagiarizing a paper, or any copying visual material without giving
          appropriate credit will:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fail the assignment</li>
          <li>Be subject to removal from and failure of the course</li>
          <li>
            Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the
            University.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Digital Privacy @ CADA</h2>
        <p>
          The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts (CADA) strives to
          safeguard the privacy of its faculty, students, prospective students,
          and employees in online learning environments and other online events
          and activities hosted or sponsored by the College.
        </p>
        <p>
          The College may record online events for internal use and faculty may
          record and post live online lectures on Blackboard, UIC's internal
          Content Management System; those recordings are permitted under these
          guidelines. However, the meeting host should endeavor to give notice
          whenever an online class or event is being recorded. If any student is
          identifiable in an image or recording from an online class,
          distributing that content publicly (i.e., outside of password
          protected Blackboard) may constitute a violation of the educational
          record protections provided under FERPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals who suspect a violation has occurred should report that
          matter to Assistant Dean Dina Taylor (dltaylor@uic.edu) or Associate
          Dean Cheryl Towler Weese (cheryltw@uic.edu).
        </p>
        <h2>Lecture Recordings</h2>
        <p>
          Occasionally, class sessions may be recorded via Zoom (or a similar
          platform) for the purposes of study / review or for students who are
          unable to attend an in-class session. Your instructor will inform you
          if they plan to record the lecture. The “record” feature for students
          will be disabled so that no one may be able to record the session
          without your knowledge. Recording in-class lectures without the
          permission of the instructor is not permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in lecture
          recordings, you may turn OFF your video and notify the instructor. If
          you prefer to use a pseudonym on screen instead of your name, please
          let the instructor know what name you will be using, so that they can
          identify you during the class session. If you wish to ask a question
          but don’t want your name to appear in the chat, you may direct-message
          the instructor through the chat feature. If you have questions or
          concerns about this video recording policy, please contact the
          instructor before the end of the first week of class.
        </p>
        <p>
          These guidelines do not restrict a student's right to record lectures
          or download content pursuant to the
          <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/accommodations/assistive-technology/"
            >assistive technology accommodations</a

        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to maintain a learning environment where everyone
          feels comfortable participating. To protect these interests, students
          and other participants may not copy, record, reproduce, screenshot,
          photograph, or distribute the following content:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Live discussions or meetings</li>
          <li>Discussion boards</li>
          <li>Rehearsals, Critiques, and other creative activity</li>
          <li>Images of students, faculty, or other participants</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any attempt to disrupt an online course or event (e.g., "Zoombombing")
          or to use the College's online platforms to introduce malware or gain
          unpermitted access to files or networks is prohibited and may violate
          other University policies depending on the nature of manner of the
          conduct. Students who violate this policy may be subject to
          disciplinary action under the UIC Student Disciplinary Policy.
