  <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
  <p>Introduction to New Media Arts is a studio-based course that introduces theories and practices in new media art forms along with hands on workshops of creative computing, circuitry design, basic to intermediate electronics, and technological interactivity. Students will learn to use computer programming to create interactive sound, light, and environmental interfaces using an array of native applications to device art (microcontrollers such as the Circuit Playground Express). This course also adopts strategies for scientific inquiry from an artistic lens as well introduces current and historical new media artists through lectures presenting history, theory, and contemporary practices of new media artworks.</p>
  
  <p>The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.</p>
  
  <p>Students are required to have a device that enables internet browsing and downloading large files.</p>
  
  <h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
  <ul>
    Students will: 
    <li>Draw inspiration from the history of artists and designers who explore ideas and applications of interactivity</li>
    
    <li>Gain practical experience with basic electronics, coding, and other techniques related to digital art production</li>
    
    <li>Develop experimental art, interactive objects, and responsive environment projects based on conceptual assignments</li>
    
    <li>Research digital and experimental artworks and trends</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
  
  <h5>Department of Art, UIC</h5>
  
  <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
  <p>This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>

  <h3>Grading Key</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
  </ul>

  *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of receiving
  credit. 
  <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10% -  Participation is worth 10% of your grade. Class participation includes lab time, workshops, critiques, discussions, and overall active engagement in class.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">35% - The conceptual art Project Assignments are weighted at approximately 35% of the total grade. These assignments will be discussed in class and will be posted on the course website with adequate time for completion. These include major assignments geared towards helping you gain technical skills and to broadening your understanding of new media arts.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10% - Practical Assignments – There will be practical homework assignments to help you gain technical skills. They are worth 10% collectively.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20% - The Final Project is worth 20% of your grade. The final project will consist of an artistic work or installation of your choice, utilizing the skills obtained in lab exercises and inspired by course content. Please see the homework and assignments section for my details.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10% - Final Project Documentation – Completed Documentation of your final project uploaded to the class Blog.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15% - Blog assignments count towards 15% of your total grade and are graded upon the insight in your writing and your overall understanding and resourcefulness of the information given. Each week we will look at several new media artists and projects and you will be asked to submit a short one-paragraph response about a specific topic (TBD weekly by the instructor) to the class blog. Feel free to use the blog for things other than just required weekly responses. The class blog is a place meant for you to share your ideas about class topics, resources, collaborative ideas, and interesting projects that you might come across. I will email you a link to join the class blog, be sure to accept the invitation so you can post your weekly responses if you have any problems please let me know.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Attendance</h3>
  <p>
    Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
  </p>
  <ul>
    
    <li>Maximum = two unexcused absences for the semester.</li>
    
    <li>Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.</li>
    
    <li>One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.</li>
    
    <li>Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.</li>
    
    <li>Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is equivalent to not having your work ready. - It will result in a failing grade for that assignment.</li>
    
    <li>Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.
  </p>
  <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
  
  <p>Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.</p>
  
  <p>UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
  
  <p>Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123 (TDD).</p>
  
  <p>During the first week of the semester a student who has a letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule a meeting with their instructor(s) so that you may create + agree upon a clear plan for implementing accommodations.</p>
  
  
<h2>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural
  diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or
  requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays.
  Students who wish to observe their religious holidays must notify the
  instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be absent unless their
  religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day, in such case
  students must notify instructor at least five days in advance of the date when
  he or she will be absent.

  >
</p>
<h2>Safe Space</h2>
<p>
  The UIC School of Art & Art History is committed to creating a safe space in
  our classrooms that is a welcoming, supportive, and safe environment for
  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students. See also:

<h2>Image Reproduction</h2>
<p>
  Images of projects created in this course may be used for educational
  purposes, including instruction in future courses and promotion of the School,
  College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or distributing any
  of your work for these purposes, please discuss these with your instructor.
</p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught copying homework,
  plagiarizing a paper, or any copying visual material without giving
  appropriate credit will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fail the assignment</li>
  <li>Be subject to removal from and failure of the course</li>
  <li>
    Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the
    University.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Digital Privacy @ CADA</h2>
<p>
  The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts (CADA) strives to safeguard
  the privacy of its faculty, students, prospective students, and employees in
  online learning environments and other online events and activities hosted or
  sponsored by the College.
</p>
<p>
  The College may record online events for internal use and faculty may record
  and post live online lectures on Blackboard, UIC's internal Content Management
  System; those recordings are permitted under these guidelines. However, the
  meeting host should endeavor to give notice whenever an online class or event
  is being recorded. If any student is identifiable in an image or recording
  from an online class, distributing that content publicly (i.e., outside of
  password protected Blackboard) may constitute a violation of the educational
  record protections provided under FERPA.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who suspect a violation has occurred should report that matter to
  Assistant Dean Dina Taylor (dltaylor@uic.edu) or Associate Dean Cheryl Towler
  Weese (cheryltw@uic.edu).
</p>
<h2>Lecture Recordings</h2>
<p>
  Occasionally, class sessions may be recorded via Zoom (or a similar platform)
  for the purposes of study / review or for students who are unable to attend an
  in-class session. Your instructor will inform you if they plan to record the
  lecture. The “record” feature for students will be disabled so that no one may
  be able to record the session without your knowledge. Recording in-class
  lectures without the permission of the instructor is not permitted.
</p>
<p>
  If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in lecture recordings,
  you may turn OFF your video and notify the instructor. If you prefer to use a
  pseudonym on screen instead of your name, please let the instructor know what
  name you will be using, so that they can identify you during the class
  session. If you wish to ask a question but don’t want your name to appear in
  the chat, you may direct-message the instructor through the chat feature. If
  you have questions or concerns about this video recording policy, please
  contact the instructor before the end of the first week of class.
</p>
<p>
  These guidelines do not restrict a student's right to record lectures or
  download content pursuant to the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/accommodations/assistive-technology/"
    >assistive technology accommodations</a
  >
  outlined by the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/">UIC Disability Resource Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is also important to maintain a learning environment where everyone feels
  comfortable participating. To protect these interests, students and other
  participants may not copy, record, reproduce, screenshot, photograph, or
  distribute the following content:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live discussions or meetings</li>
  <li>Discussion boards</li>
  <li>Rehearsals, Critiques, and other creative activity</li>
  <li>Images of students, faculty, or other participants</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any attempt to disrupt an online course or event (e.g., "Zoombombing") or to
  use the College's online platforms to introduce malware or gain unpermitted
  access to files or networks is prohibited and may violate other University
  policies depending on the nature of manner of the conduct. Students who
  violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action under the UIC
  Student Disciplinary Policy.
</p>

<h2>Student Disciplinary Policy</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a

    >Student Disciplinary Policy</a
  >
  is the University's process to handle allegations of misconduct by UIC
