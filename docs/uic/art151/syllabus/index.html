<div class="md-block"><p>This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on using creative practices to formulate new ideas. No previous programming experience is required. Students will develop a technical aptitude for generating dynamic and data-driven visual projects, and through a socio-historical analysis of computation, art and philosophy, contextualize their projects with an understanding of how computation has augmented how we make meaning from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students will experiment and develop their own strategies to develop and evaluate project rubrics and goals. Students will complete the class with a foundation of technical skills to pursue individual learning of more advanced programming, scripting, and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
<p>The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.</p>
</div>


<h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
 
<div class="md-block"><ul>
<li>Acquire a vocabulary to unpack programming concepts and techniques with confidence.</li>
<li>Critically examining how new media art is entangled in histories of culture and technology.</li>
<li>Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging with computation</li>
<li>Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.</li>
<li>Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.</li>
<li>Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful artistic compositions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h5>Department of Art, UIC</h5>

<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p>This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>



<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">A Work is of exceptionally high quality both technically and conceptually. The student and work exhibits ambition that is successfully realized far beyond the level required and could not be improved in any way. The student takes big risks! The student is always on time and prepared, vocal in class, inquisitive, and clearly invested in what they are thinking about and making both in class and outside of class. The student takes copious notes and refers to their notes regularly. Projects must show significant growth between class periods. The student must display significant growth over the course of the semester through risk, experimentation, and care for their work and what they are learning.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">B Work is of good effort with creative ideas, but not accomplished to fully embody the initial conceptual or formal impetus. The student and their work display little risk in creative execution of projects and remains steadfast in their familiar ways of working and thinking. Ideas are safe and predictable. The student takes notes randomly and hardly refers to them. The student is on time but scattered and less prepared.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">C Work is average, the assignments have been fulfilled and on time but with minimal effort. Barely meets the requirements of the assignment with little or no regard for the depth of the artist’s known potential. Predictably late and unprepared for class, often not taking any notes or making effort to remember what was said in class. The student is quiet during conversations and little work is being done outside of class.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">D The work does not meet the assignment’s criteria, and/or is incomplete at critique time. The student has poor attendance, is absent minded in lectures and conversations, and shows little to no work being done outside of class.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">F Failure to complete projects, or to participate in critique, or failure to arrive prepared for class routinely.</li>
  
</ul>

<div class="md-block"><h2>Disability Accomodations</h2>
<p>
  Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the
  University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people
  with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an
  academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral
  to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.
</p>
<p>
  UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative
  communication formats, and the expression of disability community and pride.
  At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair
  treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with
  disabilities.
</p>
<p>
  Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and
  participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the Disability Resource
  Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123
  (TDD).
</p>
<p>
  During the first week of the semester a student who has a letter of
  accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule a meeting with
  their instructor(s) so that you may create + agree upon a clear plan for
  implementing accommodations.
</p>
<h2>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural
  diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or
  requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays.
  Students who wish to observe their religious holidays must notify the
  instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be absent unless their
  religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day, in such case
  students must notify instructor at least five days in advance of the date when
  he or she will be absent.

</p>
<h2>Safe Space</h2>
<p>
  The UIC School of Art & Art History is committed to creating a safe space in
  our classrooms that is a welcoming, supportive, and safe environment for
  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students. See also:

<h2>Image Reproduction</h2>
<p>
  Images of projects created in this course may be used for educational
  purposes, including instruction in future courses and promotion of the School,
  College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or distributing any
  of your work for these purposes, please discuss these with your instructor.
</p>
<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught copying homework,
  plagiarizing a paper, or any copying visual material without giving
  appropriate credit will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fail the assignment</li>
  <li>Be subject to removal from and failure of the course</li>
  <li>
    Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the
    University.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Digital Privacy @ CADA</h2>
<p>
  The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts (CADA) strives to safeguard
  the privacy of its faculty, students, prospective students, and employees in
  online learning environments and other online events and activities hosted or
  sponsored by the College.
</p>
<p>
  The College may record online events for internal use and faculty may record
  and post live online lectures on Blackboard, UIC's internal Content Management
  System; those recordings are permitted under these guidelines. However, the
  meeting host should endeavor to give notice whenever an online class or event
  is being recorded. If any student is identifiable in an image or recording
  from an online class, distributing that content publicly (i.e., outside of
  password protected Blackboard) may constitute a violation of the educational
  record protections provided under FERPA.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who suspect a violation has occurred should report that matter to
  Assistant Dean Dina Taylor (dltaylor@uic.edu) or Associate Dean Cheryl Towler
  Weese (cheryltw@uic.edu).
</p>
<h2>Lecture Recordings</h2>
<p>
  Occasionally, class sessions may be recorded via Zoom (or a similar platform)
  for the purposes of study / review or for students who are unable to attend an
  in-class session. Your instructor will inform you if they plan to record the
  lecture. The “record” feature for students will be disabled so that no one may
  be able to record the session without your knowledge. Recording in-class
  lectures without the permission of the instructor is not permitted.
</p>
<p>
  If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in lecture recordings,
  you may turn OFF your video and notify the instructor. If you prefer to use a
  pseudonym on screen instead of your name, please let the instructor know what
  name you will be using, so that they can identify you during the class
  session. If you wish to ask a question but don’t want your name to appear in
  the chat, you may direct-message the instructor through the chat feature. If
  you have questions or concerns about this video recording policy, please
  contact the instructor before the end of the first week of class.
</p>
<p>
  These guidelines do not restrict a student's right to record lectures or
  download content pursuant to the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/accommodations/assistive-technology/"
    >assistive technology accommodations</a
  >
  outlined by the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/">UIC Disability Resource Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is also important to maintain a learning environment where everyone feels
  comfortable participating. To protect these interests, students and other
  participants may not copy, record, reproduce, screenshot, photograph, or
  distribute the following content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live discussions or meetings</li>
  <li>Discussion boards</li>
  <li>Rehearsals, Critiques, and other creative activity</li>
  <li>Images of students, faculty, or other participants</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any attempt to disrupt an online course or event (e.g., "Zoombombing") or to
  use the College's online platforms to introduce malware or gain unpermitted
  access to files or networks is prohibited and may violate other University
  policies depending on the nature of manner of the conduct. Students who
  violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action under the UIC
  Student Disciplinary Policy.
</p>
<h2>Student Disciplinary Policy</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://dos.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/262/2020/01/DOS_Student-Disciplinary-Policy-2020.pdf"
    >Student Disciplinary Policy</a
  >
  is the University's process to handle allegations of misconduct by UIC
  Students. The Student Disciplinary Policy addresses both academic misconduct
  (such as plagiarism, cheating, or grade tampering) and behavioral misconduct
  (such as theft, assault, under-age drinking, and drug-use.) See also:
