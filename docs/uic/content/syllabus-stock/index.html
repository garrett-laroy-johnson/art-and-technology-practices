<h2>Disability Accomodations</h2>
<p>
  >UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with
  disabilities in all aspects of university life. If you face or anticipate
  disability-related barriers while at UIC, please connect with the Disability
  Resource Center (DRC) at drc.uic.edu, via email at drc@uic.edu, or call (312)
  413-2183 to create a plan for reasonable accommodations. In order to receive
  accommodations, you will need to disclose the disability to the DRC, complete
  an interactive registration process with the DRC, and provide me with a Letter
  of Accommodation (LOA). Upon receipt of an LOA, I will gladly work with you
  and the DRC to implement approved accommodations.
</p>
<h2>Inclusivity Statement</h2>
<p>
  “UIC values diversity and inclusion. Regardless of age, disability, ethnicity,
  race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
  geographic background, religion, political ideology, language, or culture, we
  expect all members of this class to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and
  inclusive environment for every other member of our class. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to
  your inclusion, engagement, accurate assessment or achievement, please notify
  me or your TA as soon as possible.”
</p>

<h2>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural
  diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or
  requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays.
  Students who wish to observe their religious holidays must notify the
  instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be absent unless their
  religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day, in such case
  students must notify instructor at least five days in advance of the date when
  he or she will be absent.

<h2>Image Reproduction</h2>
<p>
  Images of projects created in this course may be used for educational
  purposes, including instruction in future courses and promotion of the School,
  College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or distributing any
  of your work for these purposes, please discuss these with your instructor.
</p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>
  In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught copying homework,
  plagiarizing a paper, or any copying visual material without giving
  appropriate credit will:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fail the assignment</li>
  <li>Be subject to removal from and failure of the course</li>
  <li>
    Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the
    University.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Digital Privacy @ CADA</h2>
<p>
  The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts (CADA) strives to safeguard
  the privacy of its faculty, students, prospective students, and employees in
  online learning environments and other online events and activities hosted or
  sponsored by the College.
</p>
<p>
  The College may record online events for internal use and faculty may record
  and post live online lectures on Blackboard, UIC's internal Content Management
  System; those recordings are permitted under these guidelines. However, the
  meeting host should endeavor to give notice whenever an online class or event
  is being recorded. If any student is identifiable in an image or recording
  from an online class, distributing that content publicly (i.e., outside of
  password protected Blackboard) may constitute a violation of the educational
  record protections provided under FERPA.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who suspect a violation has occurred should report that matter to
  Assistant Dean Dina Taylor (dltaylor@uic.edu) or Associate Dean Cheryl Towler
  Weese (cheryltw@uic.edu).
</p>
<h2>Lecture Recordings</h2>
<p>
  Occasionally, class sessions may be recorded via Zoom (or a similar platform)
  for the purposes of study / review or for students who are unable to attend an
  in-class session. Your instructor will inform you if they plan to record the
  lecture. The “record” feature for students will be disabled so that no one may
  be able to record the session without your knowledge. Recording in-class
  lectures without the permission of the instructor is not permitted.
</p>
<p>
  If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in lecture recordings,
  you may turn OFF your video and notify the instructor. If you prefer to use a
  pseudonym on screen instead of your name, please let the instructor know what
  name you will be using, so that they can identify you during the class
  session. If you wish to ask a question but don’t want your name to appear in
  the chat, you may direct-message the instructor through the chat feature. If
  you have questions or concerns about this video recording policy, please
  contact the instructor before the end of the first week of class.
</p>
<p>
  These guidelines do not restrict a student's right to record lectures or
  download content pursuant to the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/accommodations/assistive-technology/"
    >assistive technology accommodations</a
  >
  outlined by the
  <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/">UIC Disability Resource Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is also important to maintain a learning environment where everyone feels
  comfortable participating. To protect these interests, students and other
  participants may not copy, record, reproduce, screenshot, photograph, or
  distribute the following content:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live discussions or meetings</li>
  <li>Discussion boards</li>
  <li>Rehearsals, Critiques, and other creative activity</li>
  <li>Images of students, faculty, or other participants</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any attempt to disrupt an online course or event (e.g., "Zoombombing") or to
  use the College's online platforms to introduce malware or gain unpermitted
  access to files or networks is prohibited and may violate other University
  policies depending on the nature of manner of the conduct. Students who
  violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action under the UIC
  Student Disciplinary Policy.
</p>

<h2>Student Disciplinary Policy</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a

    >Student Disciplinary Policy</a

  is the University's process to handle allegations of misconduct by UIC
  Students. The Student Disciplinary Policy addresses both academic misconduct
  (such as plagiarism, cheating, or grade tampering) and behavioral misconduct
  (such as theft, assault, under-age drinking, and drug-use.) See also:
