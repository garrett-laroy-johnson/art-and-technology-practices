  <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
  <p>Post-modernist and post-structuralist art, architecture, literature, music and performance have often made overtures to the chaotic, while admitting the creative act always requires structuration driven by a more-than-human intentionality (see Cage’s definition of music as “organized sound”). Sidestepping aesthetics altogether, Feminist scholar Elizabeth Grosz understands art as a non-extraordinary rerouting of the chaotic forces of the earth to create a territory. A territory is a culture, a culture of intensities. For psychoanalyst and activist Felix Guattari, the artist, and perhaps exceptionally the improviser, must open themselves onto the cosmos — which he calls the chaosmos.</p>
  
  <p>Despite historical adoration for chaos as a catalyst for creativity, appeals to chaos might feel exasperating in 2023. The founding scientists of chaos theory wrote “we grow in direct proportion to the amount of chaos we can sustain and dissipate” (Prigogyne and Stengers, 1984). Unexpected loss of human life in the pandemic, the rise of stochastic terrorism fueled by extremism, and the industrialized destruction of our very lifeworld — haven’t we had our fill of chaos?</p>
  
  <p>In four parts, this seminar charts a path across disciplines and between chaos and order in the creative act. First we begin with the scientific origins of chaos theory (Poincare’s “three body problem”), early systems theory (Von Uexhull’s ecology), and Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stenger’s seminal Order out of Chaos.</p>
  
  <p>Next we will fashion ourselves a cultural thermodynamics through science fiction (Cixin Liu, Ursula K. Le Guin) and feminist art theory (Grosz, Institute for Precarious Consciousness). Third, we find ourselves in the chaosmos (a chaotic cosmology) as articulated by activist and in-disciplinary thinker Felix Guattari as well as radical empiricist-pragmatists (Bergson, Dewey). Finally, we revisit the cybernetic bedrock of chaos theory: computation. We turn to both arguments about what it is (Galloway, Dhaliwal, Parisi), what we imagine it can do in a chaotic world(Turner, Curtis), and what we argue it can’t do (Simondon, Yuk Hui).
</p>
  
  <p>Students are encouraged to bring their own practices and perspectives to the readings and to a final paper. In addition to seminar discussions and student presentations about readings, students will choose to respond, elaborate, and interject into the course’s discourse either through creative projects or papers. Students registered in liberal arts are required to write a final paper.</p>

  <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
  
  <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
  <p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>

  
  <h3>Grading Key</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
    
  </ul>

  

  <p>
    *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of receiving
    credit.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>

  </ul>
  
  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.
  </p>
  <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
  
  <h2>Philosophy of Inclusivity</h2>
  <p>
    Education is transformative, and open intellectual inquiry is the foundation
    of a university education and a democratic society. In the spirit of shared
    humanity and concern for our community and world, I as an instructor
    celebrate diversity as central to our mission and affirm our solidarity with
    those individuals and groups most at risk. In line with these goals, I
    disavow all racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia,
    anti-Semitism, classism, ableism, and hate speech or actions that attempt to
    silence, threaten, and degrade others.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an educator, I affirm that language and texts, films and stories help us
    to understand the experiences of others whose lives are different from ours.
    I value critical reasoning, evidence-based arguments, self-reflection, and
    the imagination. Building on these capacities, I hope to inspire empathy,
    social and environmental justice, and an ethical framework for our actions.
    I advocate for a diverse campus, community, and nation inclusive of racial
    minorities, women, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of all
    religious faiths.

<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

<h2>Digital Device Policy</h2>
<p>
  The student use of various digital devices in In-Person classes, such as
  laptops, phones, tablets, etc. should be limited only to appropriate use given
  the format of the class. Use of digital devices in class to do non-class
  related work will not be allowed or tolerated.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, use of digital devices in class during screenings will not be
  allowed or tolerated. If a student has a software or hardware related problem
  please visit the CRIT Helpdesk on the 9th floor of the 112 S. Michigan
  (Maclean) Building for assistance addressing these issues.
</p>

<h2>Basic Health and Safety Information</h2>
<h5>Face Masks</h5>
<p>
  Individuals may continue to wear masks, though they will no longer be required
  in any on-campus space except at the Wellness Center.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to wear a mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask, N95, or KN95 will
  offer the best protection. Such masks provide good protection even when those
  around you are unmasked.
</p>
<h5>Symptoms and Reporting</h5>
<p>
  If you are ill, even if you’re vaccinated and/or have mild, cold-like
  symptoms, stay home. Continue to report a positive COVID-19 test or COVID-like
  symptoms to SAIC's Case Management Team. If you test positive for COVID-19,
  are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, or show signs or
  symptoms (even if they are mild, cold-like symptoms and you are fully
  vaccinated), please email SAIC’s Case Management Team at
  saic.covid.report@saic.edu.
</p>
<h5>Quarantine and Isolation</h5>
<p>
  A close contact is someone who was within six feet of a positive case for 15
  or more cumulative minutes over the course of a day starting from two days
  before the person began feeling sick or tested positive until the time they
  were isolated. SAIC no longer requires close contacts to quarantine,
  regardless of their vaccination status.
</p>
<p>
  Close contacts are required to promptly contact the Case Management Team and
  follow all instructions. These instructions will include, but are not limited
  to, testing and wearing a surgical mask, N95, or KN95 whenever they are on
  campus, except resident students in their own room. Surgical masks are
  available at security desks upon request.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who test positive must immediately contact the Case Management
  Team and follow all instructions. They may not come to campus until cleared to
  do so by the Case Management Team.
</p>

<p>
  The latest COVID-19 information and protocols can be found at
  saic.edu/maketogether. Of course, the evolving nature of the virus may require
  that we shift course as the academic year continues.
