<p>SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.</p>
