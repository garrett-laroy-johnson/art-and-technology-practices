    <h1>Audio Terrain</h1>
    <h2>Maya Roussell<h2>
      <p><em>Audio Terrain</em> is an immersive sound-responsive installation piece that records a visual, moment-to-moment history of auditory input from its surroundings throughout the course of a day. The multi-surface projection includes a stretching landscape of lines, with peaks and valleys reminiscent of both earthly terrain and the curves of a sound wave. As auditory input is received, the landscape slowly creeps upward line by line, building directly upon its previous strokes. The quality of each sound input is represented visually by its corresponding strokes, with the color and thickness of the line determined by the frequency and volume of the input, respectively. The result is an impressionable recording of events, where changing auditory conditions yield a noticeable change in the landscape. The work speaks to the unseen build up of energy and events that gathers anywhere humans reside, similar to the way sediment preserves a story occurring centuries ago, while simultaneously adding new layers atop its history. By preserving sound inputs visually, <em>Audio Terrain</em> allows one to ponder what bang may have occurred or what that silence had been like, long after the moment and its conditions have passed.
        Ideally, <em>Audio Terrain</em> would exist in a public setting with heavy foot traffic using a projector that is well equipped to compete with ambient light; however, for the purpose of this documentation, it was installed in a light-controlled space in order to accommodate the projector’s low lumen count. This documentation reflects a simulated response to daily ambient sound, such as if it were found on the side of a building near a semi-busy street. The documentation also considers other possible applications for the work, such as live visual accompaniments to experimental music venues, as demonstrated below in response to Gustav Holst’s <em>St. Paul’s Suite:IV Finale</em>, and George Gershwin’s <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em>. The piece is created to be applicable to multiple settings, as the installation will respond differently to each environment and create an experience unique to its venue.
