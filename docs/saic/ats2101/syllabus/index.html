  </ul>

  <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
  <p>What is at the intersection of art and technology? What does technology help us understand about art? How does art deepen our understanding of technology? Is all art technological?</p>
  
  <p>These questions undergird art and technology practices and studies. In this course, we&#39;ll begin to approach these generative problems by beginning to develop our technical facility and expressivity with a creative coding tool.</p>
  
  <p>Glancing at the ATS Studies course offerings, we will find that Art and Technology Studies is much more diverse and broad than digital art (generative art, interactive art, games, simulation, and machine learning), including neon fabrication, light art, robotics, bioart and biodesign, olfactory art, holography... Why then are we focusing on a single skillset?</p>
  
  <p>First let&#39;s talk about where our technical focus will be. We will work with a programming environment called p5*js. p5 is a version of Processing, a toolkit made for artists by artists. p5 is technically a library for the programming language JavaScript. One nice thing you will soon discover is that JavaScript is used in programming for the web, and so it will be very easy for us to share our creations with each other. This also means we will identify clear pathways from this work into netart, interactive art, generative art and more utilitarian skills like website building. Interactive installation, digital-physical computing, performance, games, experimental electronic literature, and simulations will not be far off either.</p>
  
  <p>If the appeal of art and technology is that we are untethered from specific media, why focus on p5, which is ostensibly a language for produing images? In short, your journey has to start somewhere. In the past I have experimented with versions of this course where we dip our toes into physical computing and games. While these arguably provide a better introduction to the breadth of skills within SAIC&#39;s ATS department, the courses were we focus on one toolkit allows students to get to a satisfying level of expertise by the end of the semester.</p>
  
  <p>What&#39;s more, p5 will build your computational thinking skills. That means that you&#39;ll have both a basis for programming that will transfer over to other media processing systems (python, max/msp, touch designer, adobe, etc.) as well as the analytic capacity for understanding the technologies than envelop us and scaffold our communities.</p>
  
  <h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
  <ul>
    Students will: 
    <li>A sense of modern digital (and analog) technology can afford your art practice</li>
    
    <li>Experience with computational thinking that you will be able to use to understand the technical systems of everyday life.</li>
    
    <li>A familiarity with diverse technical and aesthetic approaches to art and technology broadly, as well as the unique offerings of the Art and Technology Studies department at SAIC.</li>
    
    <li>Beginner+ fluency with p5*js, including arrays, functions, for loops, if conditions, and the JS object.</li>
    
    <li>Expressive facility in an aesthetic domain with these skills.</li>
    
    <li>Sketches with diverse media processing techniques that may seed further work</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
  
  <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
  <p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>

  <h3>Grading Key</h3>

  *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of receiving
  credit. 
  <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Coding Sketches (8) These eight assignments will build your technical skills. They are assigned in weeks when we are not prepping for projects.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Projects (3) These three projects give you the opportunity to bring your artistic practice together with the technical skills you&#39;ve developed.</li>

  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.
  </p>
  <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
  
  <h2>Philosophy of Inclusivity</h2>
  <p>
    Education is transformative, and open intellectual inquiry is the foundation
    of a university education and a democratic society. In the spirit of shared
    humanity and concern for our community and world, I as an instructor
    celebrate diversity as central to our mission and affirm our solidarity with
    those individuals and groups most at risk. In line with these goals, I
    disavow all racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia,
    anti-Semitism, classism, ableism, and hate speech or actions that attempt to
    silence, threaten, and degrade others.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an educator, I affirm that language and texts, films and stories help us
    to understand the experiences of others whose lives are different from ours.
    I value critical reasoning, evidence-based arguments, self-reflection, and
    the imagination. Building on these capacities, I hope to inspire empathy,
    social and environmental justice, and an ethical framework for our actions.
    I advocate for a diverse campus, community, and nation inclusive of racial
    minorities, women, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of all
    religious faiths.

<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

</p>

<h2>Basic Health and Safety Information</h2>
<h5>Face Masks</h5>
<p>
  Individuals may continue to wear masks, though they will no longer be required
  in any on-campus space except at the Wellness Center.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to wear a mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask, N95, or KN95 will
  offer the best protection. Such masks provide good protection even when those
  around you are unmasked.
</p>
<h5>Symptoms and Reporting</h5>
<p>
  If you are ill, even if you’re vaccinated and/or have mild, cold-like
  symptoms, stay home. Continue to report a positive COVID-19 test or COVID-like
  symptoms to SAIC's Case Management Team. If you test positive for COVID-19,
  are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, or show signs or
  symptoms (even if they are mild, cold-like symptoms and you are fully
  vaccinated), please email SAIC’s Case Management Team at
  saic.covid.report@saic.edu.
</p>
<h5>Quarantine and Isolation</h5>
<p>
  A close contact is someone who was within six feet of a positive case for 15
  or more cumulative minutes over the course of a day starting from two days
  before the person began feeling sick or tested positive until the time they
  were isolated. SAIC no longer requires close contacts to quarantine,
  regardless of their vaccination status.
</p>
<p>
  Close contacts are required to promptly contact the Case Management Team and
  follow all instructions. These instructions will include, but are not limited
  to, testing and wearing a surgical mask, N95, or KN95 whenever they are on
  campus, except resident students in their own room. Surgical masks are
  available at security desks upon request.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who test positive must immediately contact the Case Management
  Team and follow all instructions. They may not come to campus until cleared to
  do so by the Case Management Team.
</p>
