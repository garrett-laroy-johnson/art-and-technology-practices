  <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
  <p>In this seminar, we take the programmatic text “We are All Very Anxious” by The Institute for Precarious Consciousness (2014) as a touchstone. Taking up their injunction that we need to build “machines for fighting anxiety”, students will situate their art practice to pursue a research question intervening between the social and the psychic, the ecological and the cultural. Through a blend of seminar discussion, research, workshop, tutorial, we will examine and engage contemporary techniques that help us to ask what anxiety is in 2022, what it does, and most importantly, what it could do. Students should be prepared to exercise their metier towards new ends.</p>
  
  <p>Broken into thirds, the course pairs traditions of theorizing anxiety with techniques that appropriate the conditioning of aesthetic experience towards the production of subjectivity. We explore the psychoanalytic anxiety of Freud and Lacan as well as the mental ecosophy of Felix Guattari through works of theory-fiction or hyperstition —- quasi-archeological texts that generate worlds through bifurcation, paradox, and supposition. Second, Critical making, creating “objects to think with” that enact critiques and help us reorient to our problems, allows for a unique approach to the psychopolitical moblizations of anxiety as theorized by Byung Chul Han and Renata Salecl. Finally, we approach a materialist reading of anxiety as found in Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technology through works of speculative design.</p>
  
  <p>In 5 tutorial/workshops, students will be invited to extend their practice through computational media techniques. Provided by the instructor or technically fluent students in the class, the exact topics will be subject to the appetite of students. Some examples include digital-physical computing, non-linear video editing, projection mapping, field recording-composition, and generative sound.</p>
  
  <h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
  <ul>
    Students will: 
    <li>Motivate an arts-research perspective which intertwines theoretical analysis and proposition with practice-based speculation and world-making</li>
    
    <li>Create a feedback loop between the social, political, and psychological accounts of anxiety and art-making practice</li>
    
    <li>Familiarity and facility in thinking both contemporary and 20th century on topics of subjectivity, psyche, unconscious and anxiety.</li>
    
    <li>Updated accounts of new media in light of media philosophical accounts of mind and information</li>
    
    <li>Greater confidence in using theory in discussion of art practices</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
  
  <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
  <p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>

  <h3>Grading Key</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
  </ul>

  *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of receiving
  credit. 
  <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Seminar readings | Each week we will devote a substantial portion of class to reading and discussion. These discussions will be prompted by peer presentations. You are expected to contribute to discussion and engage actively through analysis and reflection on the text as well as relating relevant outside works. Just because a peer is presenting does now mean you do not need to do the reading.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">You will work prepare and guide discussion of one of our texts during class. Signups will happen in the second week of class. You are expected to have read and *studied* the text as well as researched its contexts and secondary literature. You will start class with a 20-30 minute presentation in which you 1) make legible to your peers in terms of its internal logic and extrinsic sociocultural, economic, theoretical and art historical connections 2) through leading the class through close reading, explicate key sections of the text that demand slow study 3) articulate clearly the stakes of the text for our contemporary moment, as it concerns new media artists 4) pose several key questions driven by the text that will lead discussion</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">You will draw on your existing art practice to engage the topics of the course in an applied work. Given the technological focus of the course, it’s expected to engage with new (or old) media in some way. As you will find in the schedule below, three weeks are devoted to critiques a project proposal, a work in-progress showing, and a final project showing.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Attendance</h3>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <ul>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.
  </p>
  <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
  
  
<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

<h2>Digital Device Policy</h2>
<p>
  The student use of various digital devices in In-Person classes, such as
  laptops, phones, tablets, etc. should be limited only to appropriate use given
  the format of the class. Use of digital devices in class to do non-class
  related work will not be allowed or tolerated.
</p>
<p>

  allowed or tolerated. If a student has a software or hardware related problem
  please visit the CRIT Helpdesk on the 9th floor of the 112 S. Michigan
  (Maclean) Building for assistance addressing these issues.
</p>

<h2>Basic Health and Safety Information</h2>
<h5>Face Masks</h5>
<p>
  Individuals may continue to wear masks, though they will no longer be required
  in any on-campus space except at the Wellness Center.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to wear a mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask, N95, or KN95 will
  offer the best protection. Such masks provide good protection even when those
  around you are unmasked.
</p>
<h5>Symptoms and Reporting</h5>
<p>
  If you are ill, even if you’re vaccinated and/or have mild, cold-like
  symptoms, stay home. Continue to report a positive COVID-19 test or COVID-like
  symptoms to SAIC's Case Management Team. If you test positive for COVID-19,
  are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, or show signs or
  symptoms (even if they are mild, cold-like symptoms and you are fully
  vaccinated), please email SAIC’s Case Management Team at
  saic.covid.report@saic.edu.
</p>
<h5>Quarantine and Isolation</h5>
<p>
  A close contact is someone who was within six feet of a positive case for 15
  or more cumulative minutes over the course of a day starting from two days
  before the person began feeling sick or tested positive until the time they
  were isolated. SAIC no longer requires close contacts to quarantine,
  regardless of their vaccination status.
</p>
<p>
  Close contacts are required to promptly contact the Case Management Team and
  follow all instructions. These instructions will include, but are not limited
  to, testing and wearing a surgical mask, N95, or KN95 whenever they are on
  campus, except resident students in their own room. Surgical masks are
  available at security desks upon request.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who test positive must immediately contact the Case Management
  Team and follow all instructions. They may not come to campus until cleared to
  do so by the Case Management Team.
</p>

  saic.edu/maketogether. Of course, the evolving nature of the virus may require
  that we shift course as the academic year continues.
