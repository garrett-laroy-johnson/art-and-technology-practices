      - Have a look at the gen~ examples (help > examples > gen), especially the ones listed below. 
      - Develop a patch that has 3 distinct parts. One part makes sounds (synthesis). One part modulates that sound (effects chain). You can have one or several effects (experiment with the order). A final component should structure sound over time.
