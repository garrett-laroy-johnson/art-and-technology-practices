     Project 1: Performative Intervention
  text:
   -  Using the gen~ patch from your pressure project as a starting point, create a performance device using your Daisy and potentiometer.  
   - prepare a 2-minute performance. Think back to your initial 60-second performance; you should have a beginning middle and end. 
  requirements: 
    - gen~ code successfully ported to Daisy 
    - use at least one potentiometer in the performance
    - a button is a plus 
    - responds to the environment successfully
