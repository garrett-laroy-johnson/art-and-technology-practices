   title: Getting Started with Gen~
   text: 
    - Your assignment is to spend at least 3 hours immersed in Gen~ content. This is a totally new context for creating and will require a significant time investment over the course of the semester. We need to front load that.  
   requirements: 
    - download Max 8 from www.cycling74.com. You may need to make an account and begin a free trial. License codes will be supplied from your course fee before that ends. 
    - Watch the videos below in order. Patch along with the first and second. Save the patches as separate patches. 
    - Zip the patches together and submit to Blackboard.
