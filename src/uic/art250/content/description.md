Sound and media art works at the edge of ecology. In fact, many artist and theorists are interested in how media and sound themselves are part of ecology.

In this studio class, students will learn to program the nascent microcomputer Daisy. We will program Daisy ourselves using a patcher style visual programming language called Gen~ built inside of the sound program MaxMSP. Connecting potentiometers and LEDs we will work to create synthesizers for performances we design in response to natural and built environments. With compact microphones, light sensors, and speakers, we will create responsive media systems that form feedback loops with the surrounding ecology.

Our studio practice will be enriched by readings and critiques of important artists working in this field, such as David Dunn, Hildegard von Westerkamp, Lauren Sarah Hayes, Francisco Lopez, among others.

The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.
