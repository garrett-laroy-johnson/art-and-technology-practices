This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on using creative practices to formulate new ideas. No previous programming experience is required. Students will develop a technical aptitude for generating dynamic and data-driven visual projects, and through a socio-historical analysis of computation, art and philosophy, contextualize their projects with an understanding of how computation has augmented how we make meaning from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students will experiment and develop their own strategies to develop and evaluate project rubrics and goals. Students will complete the class with a foundation of technical skills to pursue individual learning of more advanced programming, scripting, and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.

The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.
