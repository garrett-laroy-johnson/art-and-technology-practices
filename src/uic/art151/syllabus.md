location: (see course schedule)
description:
  - This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on using creative practices to formulate new ideas. No previous programming experience is required. Students will develop a technical aptitude for generating dynamic and data-driven visual projects, and through a socio-historical analysis of computation, art and philosophy, contextualize their projects with an understanding of how computation has augmented how we make meaning from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students will experiment and develop their own strategies to develop and evaluate project rubrics and goals. Students will complete the class with a foundation of technical skills to pursue individual learning of more advanced programming, scripting, and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.
  - The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.
  - Students are required to have a device that enables internet browsing and downloading large files.
objectives:
  - Acquire a vocabulary to unpack programming concepts and techniques with confidence.
  - Critically examining how new media art is entangled in histories of culture and technology.
  - Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging with computation
  - Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.
  - Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.
  - Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful artistic compositions.
grading:
  note: Department of Art, UIC
  contact: This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    a: A = outstanding accomplishment in all assignments (technically and conceptually), excellent engagement with ideas and materials, excellent participation in classroom community (vocal, inquisitive, and ALWAYS thoughtful), full attendance, exceptional progress in artistic process
    b: B = above average accomplishment in all assignments, strong engagement with ideas and materials, work falls short of fully embodying the initial conceptual or formal impetus. during class, you are invested when you choose, but lack the rigor to ALWAYS be present in class. full attendance and above average progress
    c: C = average accomplishment of all assignments, work submitted on time, some engagement with ideas and materials, some participation in classroom community, full attendance, average progress, Student shows lack of motivation and interest in thoroughly developing their skills as an artist, student, and citizen.
    d: D = the work does not meet the assignments criteria, some assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little engagement with ideas and materials, irregular or damaging participation in classroom community, irregular attendance, minimal progress
    f: F = a number of assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little or no evidence of engagement with ideas and materials, lack of participation in classroom community, failure to arrive prepared for class routinely, irregular attendance, little or no evidence of progress
  breakdown:
    - 18% - Coding Sketches
    - 18% - Project 1
    - 18% - Project 2
    - 18% - Project 3
    - 18% - Group Presentation
    - 10% - Participation
attendance:
  description: Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
  rubric:
    - Maximum = two unexcused absences for the semester.
    - Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.
    - One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.
    - Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.
    - Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is equivalent to not having your work ready. - It will result in a failing grade for that assignment.
    - Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.
assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
accomodation:
  - Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.
  - UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.
  - Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123 (TDD).
  - During the first week of the semester a student who has a letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule a meeting with their instructor(s) so that you may create + agree upon a clear plan for implementing accommodations.
