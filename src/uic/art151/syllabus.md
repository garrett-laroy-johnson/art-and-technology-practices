description:
  - This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on using creative practices to formulate new ideas. No previous programming experience is required. Students will develop a technical aptitude for generating dynamic and data-driven visual projects, and through a socio-historical analysis of computation, art and philosophy, contextualize their projects with an understanding of how computation has augmented how we make meaning from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students will experiment and develop their own strategies to develop and evaluate project rubrics and goals. Students will complete the class with a foundation of technical skills to pursue individual learning of more advanced programming, scripting, and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.
  - The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.
  - Students are required to have a device that enables internet browsing and downloading large files.
objectives:
  - Acquire a vocabulary to unpack programming concepts and techniques with confidence.
  - Critically examining how new media art is entangled in histories of culture and technology.
  - Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging with computation
  - Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.
  - Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.
  - Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful artistic compositions.
grading:
  note: Department of Art, UIC
  contact: This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    - > 
     A: Work is of exceptionally high quality both technically and conceptually. The student and work exhibits ambition that is successfully realized far beyond the level required and could not be improved in any way. The student takes big risks! The student is always on time and prepared, vocal in class, inquisitive, and clearly invested in what they are thinking about and making both in class and outside of class. The student takes copious notes and refers to their notes regularly. Projects must show significant growth between class periods. The student must display significant growth over the course of the semester through risk, experimentation, and care for their work and what they are learning. 
    - > 
     B: Work is of good effort with creative ideas, but not accomplished to fully embody the initial conceptual or formal impetus. The student and their work display little risk in creative execution of projects and remains steadfast in their familiar ways of working and thinking. Ideas are safe and predictable. The student takes notes randomly and hardly refers to them. The student is on time but scattered and less prepared. 
    - > 
     C: Work is average, the assignments have been fulfilled and on time but with minimal effort. Barely meets the requirements of the assignment with little or no regard for the depth of the artist’s known potential. Predictably late and unprepared for class, often not taking any notes or making effort to remember what was said in class. The student is quiet during conversations and little work is being done outside of class.
    - > 
     D: The work does not meet the assignment’s criteria, and/or is incomplete at critique time. The student has poor attendance, is absent minded in lectures and conversations, and shows little to no work being done outside of class.
    - > 
     F: Failure to complete projects, or to participate in critique, or failure to arrive prepared for class routinely.

attendance:
  description: 
  - This is a studio course built on active participation, making together, thinking together, and learning from one another. If you are not in class, then you cannot participate. Therefore, students are expected to attend all scheduled classes for the full duration of the course. Three unexcused absences will lower your final grade by one full letter. Excessive absences would be considered four or more and may be cause for failure in the course. Two tardies, or leaving class early, or stepping out for long durations during class time (20 minutes or more) constitutes one absence. Any absence beyond two, that is not an excused absence, will affect your grade. Excused absences are only missed classes due to the death of an immediate family member, observation of a religious holiday, hospitalization, contagious sickness, or a victim of a crime, all of which should be accompanied by appropriate documentation provided to your professor within a week of the absence. All other reasons for missing class are considered unexcused. 
  - Please note that if you communicate with your professor in advance about a class to which you will be absent, that does not mean the absence is excused. Only the reasons written above, with documentation, yield an absence as excused. Also, if you have a friend in the same class who is, on your behalf, letting your professor know that you are running late, you will still be marked tardy. 
  - Please also note that it is your responsibility to track your attendance, to remain aware of it, and to communicate with your professor if you become concerned. Your professor will be taking attendance every class period, but it is not their obligation to communicate with you if your grade is being affected by your attendance.

assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
accomodation:
  - Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.
  - UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.
  - Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123 (TDD).
  - During the first week of the semester a student who has a letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule a meeting with their instructor(s) so that you may create + agree upon a clear plan for implementing accommodations.
