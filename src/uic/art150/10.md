  description:
    - Write 250 words in response the Form+Code introduction chapter posted on this site. Include something the surprised you, something that re-inforced or resonated with what you knew from your experiences in the course, and something you are not sure you agree with.
    - Do not simply list these things -- tell us in as much detail as possible WHY you are surprised, HOW this resonated with what you already know, and WHY a statement might be disagreeable.
    - If you do not strongly disagree with anything in the text, consider what strong statements / arguments / presuppositions the authors make and ask how someone COULD disagree.
    - If you strongly disagree with something in particular in the text, explain HOW or WHY someone COULD find this agreeable.
  requirements:
    - This should be written for an audience at your current level of familiarity with art, technology, and new media. You may consider writing this for a hypothetical future version of yourself to read that gives you a snapshot of where you are at in your learning.
    - include examples and details about what you have learned and applied already in processing sketches and electronics projects.
