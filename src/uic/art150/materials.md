    note:
computer:
  - name: desktop or laptop computer
    children:
      - modern (<10 years minimum, <5 years recommended)
      - preferred Windows 7+ || Mac OS. Chrome OS || Linux may work for many p5 assignments but some i/o libraries may not be - supported. **Chrome OS and Linux** not supported for MaxMSP!
      - ideally a working microphone and camera
      - understand the age and power of your computer will introduce performance limitations for more advanced project applications
      - You can’t code on a mobile phone or tablet, so that won’t be a substitution. Since you will need to be able to screen share, it’s recommended to Zoom from the same device you’re using to code.
  - name: reliable internet connection
    children:
      - use on-campus WIFI or library WIFI if home internet is not reliable
      - if you need to use a VPN to access Zoom servers, test that ahead of time
      - consider using a wired ethernet connection instead of WIFI to optimize the bandwidth
      - this doesn’t mean I won’t understand if your internet flubs out one time
  - name: Zoom software
    children:
      - up-to-date zoom client
      - camera on is not required and will not be enforced in class. If you plan to not use a camera for any portion of class, I kindly invite you to include a fun or engaging photo profile photo :)
