description:
  - Introduction to New Media Arts is a studio-based course that introduces theories and practices in new media art forms along with hands on workshops of creative computing, circuitry design, basic to intermediate electronics, and technological interactivity. Students will learn to use computer programming to create interactive sound, light, and environmental interfaces using an array of native applications to device art (microcontrollers such as the Circuit Playground Express). This course also adopts strategies for scientific inquiry from an artistic lens as well introduces current and historical new media artists through lectures presenting history, theory, and contemporary practices of new media artworks.
  - The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.
  - Students are required to have a device that enables internet browsing and downloading large files.
objectives:
  - Draw inspiration from the history of artists and designers who explore ideas and applications of interactivity
  - Gain practical experience with basic electronics, coding, and other techniques related to digital art production
  - Develop experimental art, interactive objects, and responsive environment projects based on conceptual assignments
  - Research digital and experimental artworks and trends
grading:
  note: Department of Art, UIC
  contact: This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3-5 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    a: A = outstanding accomplishment in all assignments (technically and conceptually), excellent engagement with ideas and materials, excellent participation in classroom community (vocal, inquisitive, and ALWAYS thoughtful), full attendance, exceptional progress in artistic process
    b: B = above average accomplishment in all assignments, strong engagement with ideas and materials, work falls short of fully embodying the initial conceptual or formal impetus. during class, you are invested when you choose, but lack the rigor to ALWAYS be present in class. full attendance and above average progress
    c: C = average accomplishment of all assignments, work submitted on time, some engagement with ideas and materials, some participation in classroom community, full attendance, average progress, Student shows lack of motivation and interest in thoroughly developing their skills as an artist, student, and citizen.
    d: D = the work does not meet the assignments criteria, some assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little engagement with ideas and materials, irregular or damaging participation in classroom community, irregular attendance, minimal progress
    f: F = a number of assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little or no evidence of engagement with ideas and materials, lack of participation in classroom community, failure to arrive prepared for class routinely, irregular attendance, little or no evidence of progress
  breakdown:
    - 10% -  Participation is worth 10% of your grade. Class participation includes lab time, workshops, critiques, discussions, and overall active engagement in class.
    - 35% - The conceptual art Project Assignments are weighted at approximately 35% of the total grade. These assignments will be discussed in class and will be posted on the course website with adequate time for completion. These include major assignments geared towards helping you gain technical skills and to broadening your understanding of new media arts.
    - 10% - Practical Assignments – There will be practical homework assignments to help you gain technical skills. They are worth 10% collectively.
    - 20% - The Final Project is worth 20% of your grade. The final project will consist of an artistic work or installation of your choice, utilizing the skills obtained in lab exercises and inspired by course content. Please see the homework and assignments section for my details.
    - 10% - Final Project Documentation – Completed Documentation of your final project uploaded to the class Blog.
    - 15% - Blog assignments count towards 15% of your total grade and are graded upon the insight in your writing and your overall understanding and resourcefulness of the information given. Each week we will look at several new media artists and projects and you will be asked to submit a short one-paragraph response about a specific topic (TBD weekly by the instructor) to the class blog. Feel free to use the blog for things other than just required weekly responses. The class blog is a place meant for you to share your ideas about class topics, resources, collaborative ideas, and interesting projects that you might come across. I will email you a link to join the class blog, be sure to accept the invitation so you can post your weekly responses if you have any problems please let me know.
attendance:
  description: Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
  makeup: For any absence to be considered excused, you will need to document 2 hours research, coding, or otherwise experimenting with creative code. Documentation can be a PDF that logs every 15 minutes with links to tutorials, coding screen shots, or similar.  
  rubric:
    - Maximum = two unexcused absences for the semester.
    - Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.
    - One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.
    - Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.
    - Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is equivalent to not having your work ready. - It will result in a failing grade for that assignment.
    - Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.
assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
accomodation:
  - Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.
