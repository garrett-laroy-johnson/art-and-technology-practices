  title: "Project 1: Generative Lantern"
  text:
    - You will create your own lantern. You are given a template for a lantern with five vertical faces, a base, and a top. You are to modify the five vertical faces with compositions created in Processing. You may also create a design for the top.
    - The lantern will be laser cut in the UIC New Media Art fabrication lab next to our classroom. You'll assemble it yourself and apply adhesive as needed.
    - You will submit 5 SVG files generated in processing (or 6 if you are creating a designed top). These files will be imported into a larger "batch" file. That batch file will be sent to the laser cutter to create your panels and several others.
    - In class, you will learn to use your new Circuit Playground as a light source for your lantern.
