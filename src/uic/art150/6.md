  title: "Project 1: Generative Lantern"
  requirements:
    - Consult the diagrams below to make sure the proportions of your designs will fit the way you want onto the faces and top of the lanterns. Ultimately your designs will export to a scalable vector graphics file (.svg) that will allow us to resize it without pixelation, however an incorrect ratio will result in stretching or compression of your graphics.
    - For the top design, ensure you have used a square canvas size (e.g. 400x400, 800x,800) and all of the elements fit within a circle with a diameter spanning the width and height of the canvas
    - For your designs for the side faces, you have used a canvas size that corresponds to the height and width ratio of the side face. The total area of the side face is 6 1/4" x 3 1/8", so a suitable resolution will reflect this 2:1 ratio (e.g. 800 x 400, 1562 x 781, etc.)
    - Export your sketches as SVG files. You should plan to export 1 file per unique face of the lantern. Use the example code below as a template.
    - Place all SVG files in one directory. Compress (zip) that directory and submit that to Blackboard.
  text:
    - You will create your own lantern. You are given a template for a lantern with five vertical faces, a base, and a top. You are to modify the five vertical faces with compositions created in Processing. You may also create a design for the top.
    - The lantern will be laser cut in the UIC New Media Art fabrication lab next to our classroom. You'll assemble it yourself and apply adhesive as needed.
    - You will submit 5 SVG files generated in processing (or 6 if you are creating a designed top). These files will be imported into a larger "batch" file. That batch file will be sent to the laser cutter to create your panels and several others.
    - In class, you will learn to use your new Circuit Playground as a light source for your lantern.
