  text:
    - Find a selfie or take one. Create an interpretation of it using 2D shapes in
      P5.JS. You can to be accurate, or create an interesting abstraction based on
      the image.
    - Bonus for using more advanced 2D primitives -- quads, arcs, and I encourage
      you to lookup how to use Vertexes!
