# Sketchbook

You will actively contribute to a digital sketchbook throughout your six weeks in this course. It will include all of your created materials that satisfy assignments.

## Platform:

### Editor.p5js.org

- You will create an account on [editor.p5js.org](editor.p5js.org).
- It does not matter what email you associate with it.

### Sketches

- For weeks 3-5, two coding sketches will be due. Week 2 will ask for only one coding sketch.
- Sketches are sketches. They are not complete, polish artworks. But with more time, they could be.
- You should strive to make your two sketches for each week distinct.
- Each sketch must be saved as its own unique sketch.
- **Do not overwrite old sketches**.
- **SAVE FREQUENTLY**.
- You will also have a project, which must be its own sketch as well.
- Your sketches must be titled in a standardized way. This makes the process so much easier for your instructors.
- For instance, Week 3 will have two sketches due, and so you will add both sketches
- - `3.1-NAME-TITLE` and `3.2-NAME-TITLE`. Title is optional. Name can be initials, first and/or last name -- just something distinguishing.

### Collection

- Your "sketchbook" will be contained together as an editor.p5\*js `Collection`.
- When you create the account, create a collection:
- - Hover over your account name, top right.
- - Go to `My Collections`.
- - Click `Create Collection`.
- - Title it `S25-ATSP2101-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME`.
- - Send this link to our TA Week 2. We will make sure you are up-to-date on your work throughout the creative coding unit.
- Each time you complete a sketch, add it to the collection. This is your responsibility.

#### Collection Layout

We already know what the layout will be. Here is an example, as if your instructor was submitting a sketchbook.

#### Collection name: `S25-ATSP2101-JOHNSON-GARRETT-LAROY`

#### Sketches:

- `2.1-GLJ-PORTRAIT`
- `3.1-GLJ`
- `3.2-GLJ`
- `4.1-GLJ`
- `4.2-GLJ`
- `5.1-GLJ`
- `5.2-GLJ`
- `6.1-GLJ-PROJECT`

## Missing Work

You are allowed to miss two coding sketches. Any more than this will result in an NCR (No Credit Received) grade.

## On-time Work

This material builds.

You will be given studio time to complete these sketches and you will need to take time outside of class to finish them.

You will be held to the standard of iterative learning, which means that your assignments help to solidify concepts each week.

Turning in all your material at once at the end of the semester does not meet that standard.
