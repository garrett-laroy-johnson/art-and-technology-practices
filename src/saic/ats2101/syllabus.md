description:
- This team-taught, introductory course provides a foundation for most additional coursework in the Art and Technology Studies department. Students are given a broad interdisciplinary grounding in the skills, concepts, and hands-on experiences they will need to engage the potentials of new technologies in art making. Every other week, a lecture and discussion group exposes students to concepts of electronic media, perception, inter-media composition, emerging venues, and other issues important to artists working with technologically based media. Students will attend a morning & afternoon section each day to gain hands-on experience with a variety of forms and techniques central to technologically-based art making. 
objectives:
  - A sense of modern digital (and analog) technology can afford your art practice
  - Experience with computational thinking that you will be able to use to understand the technical systems of everyday life.
  - A familiarity with diverse technical and aesthetic approaches to art and technology broadly, as well as the unique offerings of the Art and Technology Studies department at SAIC.
  - Beginner+ fluency with p5*js, including arrays, functions, for loops, if conditions, and the JS object.
  - Expressive facility in an aesthetic domain with these skills.
  - Sketches with diverse media processing techniques that may seed further work
  - A practiced comfort level with microcontroller electronics and programming in the creation of art not limited to kinetic sculpture, interactive artwork, sound works, and responsive environments.
  - A tactile understanding of how sensors and actuators work and how they interface with computers, tether to embodiment and the environment, a connective net of energy and information.
grading:
  contact: This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    cr: (cr) credit received =  you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevent group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.
    b: (ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.

  breakdown:
    - Coding Sketches (8) These eight assignments will build your technical skills. They are assigned in weeks when we are not prepping for projects.
    - Projects (3) These three projects give you the opportunity to bring your artistic practice together with the technical skills you've developed.
    - Group Presentation (1) In small groups, you'll prepare readings,
attendance:
  - description: Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctorâ€™s note if an absence is due to illness.
assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
