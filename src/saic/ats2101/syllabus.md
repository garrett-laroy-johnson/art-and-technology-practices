description:
  - What is at the intersection of art and technology? What does technology help us understand about art? How does art deepen our understanding of technology? Is all art technological?
  - These questions undergird art and technology practices and studies. In this course, we'll begin to approach these generative problems by beginning to develop our technical facility and expressivity with a creative coding tool.
  - Glancing at the ATS Studies course offerings, we will find that Art and Technology Studies is much more diverse and broad than digital art (generative art, interactive art, games, simulation, and machine learning), including neon fabrication, light art, robotics, bioart and biodesign, olfactory art, holography... Why then are we focusing on a single skillset?
  - First let's talk about where our technical focus will be. We will work with a programming environment called p5*js. p5 is a version of Processing, a toolkit made for artists by artists. p5 is technically a library for the programming language JavaScript. One nice thing you will soon discover is that JavaScript is used in programming for the web, and so it will be very easy for us to share our creations with each other. This also means we will identify clear pathways from this work into netart, interactive art, generative art and more utilitarian skills like website building. Interactive installation, digital-physical computing, performance, games, experimental electronic literature, and simulations will not be far off either.
  - If the appeal of art and technology is that we are untethered from specific media, why focus on p5, which is ostensibly a language for produing images? In short, your journey has to start somewhere. In the past I have experimented with versions of this course where we dip our toes into physical computing and games. While these arguably provide a better introduction to the breadth of skills within SAIC's ATS department, the courses were we focus on one toolkit allows students to get to a satisfying level of expertise by the end of the semester.
  - What's more, p5 will build your computational thinking skills. That means that you'll have both a basis for programming that will transfer over to other media processing systems (python, max/msp, touch designer, adobe, etc.) as well as the analytic capacity for understanding the technologies than envelop us and scaffold our communities.
objectives:
  - A sense of modern digital (and analog) technology can afford your art practice
  - Experience with computational thinking that you will be able to use to understand the technical systems of everyday life.
  - A familiarity with diverse technical and aesthetic approaches to art and technology broadly, as well as the unique offerings of the Art and Technology Studies department at SAIC.
  - Beginner+ fluency with p5*js, including arrays, functions, for loops, if conditions, and the JS object.
  - Expressive facility in an aesthetic domain with these skills.
  - Sketches with diverse media processing techniques that may seed further work
grading:
  contact: This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    cr: (cr) credit received =  you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevent group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.
    b: (ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.

  breakdown:
    - Coding Sketches (8) These eight assignments will build your technical skills. They are assigned in weeks when we are not prepping for projects.
    - Projects (3) These three projects give you the opportunity to bring your artistic practice together with the technical skills you've developed.
    - Group Presentation (1) In small groups, you'll prepare readings,
attendance:
  - description: Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctorâ€™s note if an absence is due to illness.
assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
