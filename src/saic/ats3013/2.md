  title: "60-Second Composition" 
  text:
    - Using the "Learning Synths" playground, create a 60-second musical composition.
    - Create your own mappings from the square controller to synthesizer parameters using the map function. 
    - Submit the recording and a screen shot of your synthesizer mapping.
  requirements: 
    - has a discernable beginning, middle, and end
    - effectively uses the map feature to create a wide variety of potential sounds 
    - contains both a screen shot and an audio recording
