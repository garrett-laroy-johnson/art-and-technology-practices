     Project 1: Soundscape Intervention
  text:
   -  find a location with an interesting sonic ecology. Write 200 words about the sounds you notice thinking through each sound as a "soundmark", "signals", and "keynotes".  
   - Create a gen~ patch that sonically responds to this environment. It could add to the found sonic environment by imitating sounds, or it could contrast it in a generative way. You may perform your laptop, or let it play over time as an installation.
   - No matter which approach you choose, you will need to think about scaffolding change over time (LFOs and phasor ramps are your friends). Think in particular about 5's and 10's of second. How and why should the sound change?  
   - Record your sonic intervention with your cell phone. Aim for the highest quality recording you can get. Consider lighting and framing. You must record at least 1 minute.
   - Submit your 200 words, your patch, and your 1-minute video recording. Make a folder on your computer and zip that folder.
  requirements: 
    - submit your video documentation
    - submit the max patch that you used
