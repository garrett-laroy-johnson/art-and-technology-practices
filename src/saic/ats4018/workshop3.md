# Workshop 2: Risography + the Registration of the Self

## overview

In this workshop, you will take on a basic understanding of risographic duplication. You'll also use the program P5\*js (a popular version of Processing).

## theoretical contexts

Consider Andrew Murphie's provocation equivilancy between media and the world (going far beyond Marshall McLuhan's "medium is the message"):

> In all this data is powerful precisely because data is the potential for
> feeling that, actualized, makes the world. Working with data is this
> actualization of world in process, in and through feeling, and in and
> through the repotentializing of feeling. And data here means all data,
> not just digital data, which is only one way of moving the potential for
> feeling. This making of the world is serially immediate.

What are the data that you might mediate collectively? Across a digital realm into a printed one, into people's hands, on the subway floor, and so on?

## Deliverables

No concrete deliverables for this workshop. You are asked to play around with the Paged.js library in service of potential use in the collective, cumulative project.

## Resources

Here is a link to the [paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/) library. You will find helpful examples there, as well as a template in the "getting started" section. Note that custom pages and booklet specification is supported in Chrome.

Alternatively, you may find the archived library [Bindery.js](https://bindery.info/) useful.
