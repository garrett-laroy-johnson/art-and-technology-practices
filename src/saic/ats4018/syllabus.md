description:
  - In this seminar, we take the programmatic text “We are All Very Anxious” by The Institute for Precarious Consciousness (2014) as a touchstone. Taking up their injunction that we need to build “machines for fighting anxiety”, students will situate their art practice to pursue a research question intervening between the social and the psychic, the ecological and the cultural. Through a blend of seminar discussion, research, workshop, tutorial, we will examine and engage contemporary techniques that help us to ask what anxiety is in 2022, what it does, and most importantly, what it could do. Students should be prepared to exercise their metier towards new ends.
  - Broken into thirds, the course pairs traditions of theorizing anxiety with techniques that appropriate the conditioning of aesthetic experience towards the production of subjectivity. We explore the psychoanalytic anxiety of Freud and Lacan as well as the mental ecosophy of Felix Guattari through works of theory-fiction or hyperstition —- quasi-archeological texts that generate worlds through bifurcation, paradox, and supposition. Second, Critical making, creating “objects to think with” that enact critiques and help us reorient to our problems, allows for a unique approach to the psychopolitical moblizations of anxiety as theorized by Byung Chul Han and Renata Salecl. Finally, we approach a materialist reading of anxiety as found in Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technology through works of speculative design.
  - In 3 tutorial/workshops, students will be invited to extend their practice through computational media techniques, including a generative text in HTML, generative risographic duplication, and a generative zine 
objectives:
  - Motivate an arts-research perspective which intertwines theoretical analysis and proposition with practice-based speculation and world-making
  - Create a feedback loop between the social, political, and psychological accounts of anxiety and art-making practice
  - Familiarity and facility in thinking both contemporary and 20th century on topics of subjectivity, psyche, unconscious and anxiety.
  - Updated accounts of new media in light of media philosophical accounts of mind and information
  - Greater confidence in using theory in discussion of art practices
grading:
  contact: This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.
  key:
    cr: (cr) credit received =  you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.
    b: (ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.
  breakdown:
    - 40% - Participation in Readings and Discussions. Each week we will devote a substantial portion of class to reading and discussion. You are expected to contribute to discussion and engage actively through analysis and reflection on the text as well as relating relevant outside works. This will require a substantial and regular outside time commitment and will undergird your success in the course. 
    - 20% - Reading Presentations. Once this semester, you will work prepare and guide discussion of one of our texts during class. Signups will happen in the second week of class. You are expected to have read and intimately studied the text as well as researched its contexts and secondary literature. You will start class with a 20-30 minute presentation in which you 1) make legible to your peers in terms of its internal logic and extrinsic sociocultural, economic, theoretical and art historical connections 2) through leading the class through close reading, explicate key sections of the text that demand slow study 3) articulate clearly the stakes of the text for our contemporary moment, as it concerns new media artists 4) pose several key questions driven by the text that will lead discussion.
    - 30% - 3 mini-projects. In response to the three tutorials, you will draw on your existing art practice to engage the topics of the course in an applied work. Given the technological focus of the course, it’s likely you may engage with new (or old) media in some way, but not exclusively expected.  
    - 10% - Collective Zine. Throughout the semester, you will format the documentation of your mini-projects given a template. This will facilitate their ingression into a collective zine, which collects all students projects from the semester. Aspects of the zine may be generative (following a p5*js tutorial). The zines will be published at the end of the semester using SAIC's risographic duplicator. Your assessment here hinges on your design of collective design; how will the group decide how the projects are arranged, what colors are used, what will figure on the cover? how will the group deal with emergent questions?  
attendance:
  - description: Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
assignments: Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
