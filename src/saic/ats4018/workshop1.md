# Workshop 1: Autopoietic Heterogenesis

## overview

In this workshop, you will take a basic understanding of HTML and bring it to an experimental freewriting and artmaking project with your classmates. You will respond to their freewriting and insert your individual practice between their work.

## theoretical contexts

Consider the ecosophical context from our first few weeks. How does video feedbacks used in experimental family therapy settings related to our practices of reading and responding in hypertext? From Chaosmosis:

> "Let us now examine an example of the use of the psyche's ethological and ecological resources in the domain of family psychotherapy. We are borrowing this example from a movement which, around Mony Elkaim, is attempting to free itself from the grip of systemic theories that circulate in Anglo-Saxon countries and in Italy. Here also the inventiveness of treat ment distances us from scientific paradigms and brings us closer to an ethico-aesthetic paradigm. Therapists get involved, take risks and put their own fantasms into operation, creating a paradoxical climate of existential authenticity accompanied by a playful freedom and simulacra. Family therapy produces subjectivity in the most artificial way imaginable. This can be observed during training sessions, when the therapists improvise psychodramatic scenes. Here, the scene implies a layering of enunciation: a vision of oneself as concrete embodiment; a subject of enunciation which doubles the subject of the statement and the distribution of roles; a collective management of the game; an interlocution with observers commenting on the scene; and finally, video which through feedback restores the totality of these superposed levels. This type of performance favours the relinquishment of a "realist" attitude which would apprehend the lived scenes as actually embodied in family structures. This multi-faceted theatrical aspect allows us to grasp the artificial and creative character of the production of subjectivity."

## Deliverables

You will work in our collaborative HTML editor, [replit](https://replit.com/@gjohns13/Autopoietic-Heterogenesis). You will need to sign in with an invitation that has already been sent to you. Make sure you are editing directly in the shared document, not a copied version of it.

##### Feedback Free Writes

Your task is to three free writes. They will be in the numbered documents (1-13). After the first free write, you will be assigned to a new file, where you will respond, pick up from, correct, etc. the previous authors' work. You will do this one last time for homework in a third and final numbered document.

##### Personal Intervention

You will be assigned a letter (A-M). You will need to add a page for that letter. Add a directory with the name of the letter (e.g. /b/). Add inside a `style.css` file and an `index.html` file. Grab some html from one of the other docs, clear out their work, and start afresh.

Looking at the root `index.html` folder, identify what freewrite pages are in the neighborhood of your work (e.g. B has freewrites 1, 2, 3 in its immediate neighborhood). Read through those freewrites. This is the niche in which you will make an intervention of your own work. How will your work play with this context?

Now you are ready to begin using HTML to show some aspects of your work. Bring in elements that relate to our readings in the class so far: hyperstition, Freudian robots, the uncanny, the outside, ecosopy, the production of subjectivity, existential territories <-> incorporeal universes of reference, anxiety, and emotional capitalism. This can be work in progress, progress photos, or finished documentation. It may be more interesting to work with fragments you can reconstruct in a new way...

For information on HTML or CSS, try w3 schools, codecademy and youtube. We are not aiming for a "professional" website, but rather interested in course changes in form, style and content.
