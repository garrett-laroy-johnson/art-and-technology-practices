<h2>Class Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
  change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will be
  announced during class time when changes occur.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not
  acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied
  to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning
  as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
</p>

<h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>

<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

  allowed or tolerated. If a student has a software or hardware related problem
