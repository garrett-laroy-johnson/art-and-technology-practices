  title: Geocities Style Website
  text:
    - Create a multipage website around a hobby or a passion. A set of recipes, some photography you've done, a game or comic you really like, reviews of restaurants. Nothing serious -- remember, the internet used to be fun. 
    - Multipage means you have at least two HTML files that are linked together. Consider how people will navigate between them. 
    - You can incorporate GIFs and other media to make your website have a 90's feel if you like.
