## Getting Started

Getting p5\*js working on your website in VS code

### Make a JS file

Make a file called <code>sketch.js</code> (it can be called however you like, but this is a p5 convention for getting started).

You should populate the file with some test p5 code, so that when we run things, we see that it's working. For example:

<pre>
<code>

let x = 0;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background("#1B998B");
    circle(x,200,30);
    text("testing",x,200);
    x++;
    if (x>width+15){
        x = -15;
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

### Point to p5\*js

Add the following HTML element the <code>head</code> of the HTML page where you want to use p5\*js. This is a large file that contains all the code needed to run p5.

Notice the new <code>script</code> tag.

<code>
<pre>&lt;script&gt src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.10.0/p5.js">&ltscript&gt

</pre>
</code>

### Point to your JS file

In the <code>body</code> of your HTML code, add the following reference to your <code>sketch.js</code> file.

<code>
<pre>&lt;script&gt src="sketch.js">&ltscript&gt

</pre>
</code>

### Conclusion

If everything is working, you should have a colored rectangle with a moving circle on your webpage!
