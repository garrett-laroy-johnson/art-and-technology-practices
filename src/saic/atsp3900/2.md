## Things to include on your introduction page (respond with text and/or images)

1. What’s your preferred name (what should we call you)?
2. What’s your favorite color?
3. What’s an artwork you like? (If it’s a time-based work, we won’t have time to watch it right now, but feel free to add it anyway!)
4. Something you’re super excited about (anything!)
5. Something you’re super **NOT** excited about (anything!)
6. Something you recommend (anything! A book, an artist, a movie, show, video game, ice cream flavor, life philosophy, a keyboard (or a keyboard shortcut), a lifehack, literally anything)

Take some time to add content (text and images) to your page that responds to these prompts, then spend a little time styling the page by adding different colors and changing typography.
