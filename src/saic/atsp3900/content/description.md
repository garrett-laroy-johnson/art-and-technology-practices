**_Professional Practice: Web Art_**Â is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of the web. As a Professional Practice course, this class will foreground strategies for communicating our artistic/creative backgrounds to the public through a personal artist website, as well as actively discuss what it means to be an artist/designer/creative person in 2023.

Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now more than thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well CSS and (optionally) JavaScript to build dynamic websites. The course will combine the goals of a Professional Practices course with those of a Web Art Studio class by centering the class around building a personal portfolio website.
