  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.

  <h2>Assignments</h2>

  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.

  <h2>Philosophy of Inclusivity</h2>
  <p>
    Education is transformative, and open intellectual inquiry is the foundation
    of a university education and a democratic society. In the spirit of shared
    humanity and concern for our community and world, I as an instructor
    celebrate diversity as central to our mission and affirm our solidarity with
    those individuals and groups most at risk. In line with these goals, I
    disavow all racism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia,
    anti-Semitism, classism, ableism, and hate speech or actions that attempt to
    silence, threaten, and degrade others.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an educator, I affirm that language and texts, films and stories help us
    to understand the experiences of others whose lives are different from ours.
    I value critical reasoning, evidence-based arguments, self-reflection, and
    the imagination. Building on these capacities, I hope to inspire empathy,
    social and environmental justice, and an ethical framework for our actions.
    I advocate for a diverse campus, community, and nation inclusive of racial
    minorities, women, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of all
    religious faiths.
