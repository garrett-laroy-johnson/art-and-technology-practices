sketch:
  title: "Project 1: Generative Drawing Machine"
  requirements:
    - use at least one for loop
    - use a conditional statement
    - use at least global 4 variables that can be changed to influence the outcome of your generative drawing machine  
    - submit 3 images generated from your program
    - submit the sketch
    - zip the sketch and images together
  text:
    - Using p5*js, create a drawing machine. Think of this as a compositional system -- be able to change variables to change the kind of outputs you get. You can visualize whatever you want, but try not to simply copy and paste code from various sketchesâ€¦ understanding what the code is doing is super important!
    - You will submit your sketch and 3 images you have exported from Processing using save() that show different aspects and outcomes of your system.
