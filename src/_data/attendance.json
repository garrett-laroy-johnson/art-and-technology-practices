    "makeup": "You are responsible for looking at the website and working through the textbook in order to familiarize yourself with what was missed in class. You might also be in touch with a peer in the class to learn what was covered in the course you have missed. It is your responsibility to ask questions about subject matter you may have missed in class. I assume you are in conversation with your peers about course material regularly. Indeed I encourage the class to self-organize; take collective notes in a GoogleDoc, start a Discord, and so on, to share and learn from each other. I am happy to boost these efforts if that is helpful to you.",

      "The following had been carefully written  by the faculty of the UIC Art Department and is used in all art classes.",
      "This is a studio course built on active participation, making together, thinking together, and learning from one another. If you are not in class, then you cannot participate. Therefore, students are expected to attend all scheduled classes for the full duration of the course. Three unexcused absences will lower your final grade by one full letter. Excessive absences would be considered four or more and may be cause for failure in the course. Two tardies, or leaving class early, or stepping out for long durations during class time (20 minutes or more) constitutes one absence. Any absence beyond two, that is not an excused absence, will affect your grade. Excused absences are only missed classes due to the death of an immediate family member, observation of a religious holiday, hospitalization, contagious sickness, or a victim of a crime, all of which should be accompanied by appropriate documentation provided to your professor within a week of the absence. All other reasons for missing class are considered unexcused.",
      "*Please note that if you communicate with your professor in advance about a class to which you will be absent or tardy, that does not mean the absence or tardy is excused. Only the reasons written above, with documentation, yield an absence as excused. Also, if you have a friend in the same class who is, on your behalf, letting your professor know that you are running late, you will still be marked tardy.",
      "*Please also note that it is your responsibility to track your attendance, to remain aware of it, and to communicate with your professor if you become concerned. Your professor will be taking attendance every class period, but it is not their obligation to communicate with you if your grade is being affected by your attendance."

      "Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness (see below), all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses, including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular, independent work and study.",
      "Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only if they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course overall.",
      "More that 4 unexcused absences will result in a No Credit for the course, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade of W.",
      "Two late arrivals will count as a missed section. Â I will take attendance promptly at 6:45pm. If you arrive after that, you will be marked late."
